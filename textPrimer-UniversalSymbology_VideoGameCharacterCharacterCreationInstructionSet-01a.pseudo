// Pseudocode for Profiling a Video Game Character Using Universal Symbology and UWS
// This document outlines a step-by-step process for creating a symbolic profile of a
// video game character using the Universal Writing System (UWS).

// Step 1: Extract Information from Data Sets
// The first step is to gather all relevant information about the character from various sources.
// This data will be the raw material for the symbolic mapping.

// a. Extract from Background Data Set
// Gather narrative and gameplay information about the character.
DEFINE BackgroundData:
  Origin: // Place of birth, cultural background, species, etc.
  Role: // The character's primary function or class (e.g., warrior, mage, healer).
  PersonalityTraits: // Key adjectives describing the character's nature (e.g., brave, cunning, compassionate).
  Abilities: // Special powers, talents, or unique skills.
  Goals: // The character's primary motivations and objectives (e.g., revenge, seeking knowledge, protecting others).

// b. Extract from Astrological Data Set
// Use the character's birthdate (if available) or assign a fitting sign to gather astrological data.
// This adds a layer of archetypal meaning.
DEFINE AstrologicalData:
  ZodiacSign: // The character's zodiac sign (e.g., Aries, Taurus, etc.).
  Element: // The element associated with the sign (Fire, Water, Air, Earth).
  Modality: // The modality associated with the sign (Cardinal, Fixed, or Mutable).
  AstrologicalTraits: // Personality characteristics typically associated with the sign.

// c. Extract from Name Analysis Data Set
// Analyze the character's name for symbolic meaning.
DEFINE NameData:
  Name: // The character's full name (e.g., "Astra").
  NameMeaning: // The etymological or assigned meaning of the name (e.g., "Star" for "Astra").
  NameSymbols: // Any symbols directly associated with the name's meaning (e.g., a Star Symbol for "Astra").
  SignificantLetters: // Important initials or letters that can be turned into symbols.
  Numerology (Optional): // Assign a numerical value to the name for further symbolic mapping.

// Step 2: Map Information to Universal Symbology
// Translate the extracted data points into their corresponding UWS symbols.

// a. Assign Base Symbols
// This section lists the core symbols for quick reference during the mapping process.
DEFINE BaseSymbols:
  Point (â€¢): Represents origin, existence
  Line (â€”): Represents journey, connection
  Angle (âˆ ): Represents action, initiative
  Curve (~): Represents adaptability, change
  Circle (â—¯): Represents unity, wholeness
  Triangle (â–³): Represents strength, stability
  Square (â–¡): Represents structure, foundation
  Spiral (ðŸŒ€): Represents growth, evolution
  Wave (â‰ˆ): Represents energy, emotion

// b. Incorporate Dualities and Modalities
// Reference the dualities and modalities for mapping character traits.
DEFINE Dualities:
  MasculineSymbols: Angle, Point, Line // For active, assertive traits.
  FeminineSymbols: Curve, Circle, Wave // For passive, receptive traits.

DEFINE Modalities:
  Cardinal (Angle âˆ ): Action, direct initiative
  Fixed (Line â€”): Stability, determination
  Mutable (Curve ~): Flexibility, adaptability

// c. Reflect Astrological Elements
// Map the character's element to a specific directional or conceptual symbol.
DEFINE Elements:
  Fire (â†‘): Passion, energy
  Water (â†“): Emotion, intuition
  Air (â†”): Thought, communication
  Earth (âŠ¥): Practicality, groundedness

// Logic to assign the correct element symbol based on the AstrologicalData.
ASSIGN ElementSymbol:
  IF AstrologicalData.Element = "Fire" THEN Symbol = FireSymbol (â†‘)
  IF AstrologicalData.Element = "Water" THEN Symbol = WaterSymbol (â†“)
  IF AstrologicalData.Element = "Air" THEN Symbol = AirSymbol (â†”)
  IF AstrologicalData.Element = "Earth" THEN Symbol = EarthSymbol (âŠ¥)

// d. Map Name Meanings to Symbols
// Define specific symbols that can be derived from the character's name.
DEFINE NameSymbols:
  StarSymbol (âœ¶) // For names like "Astra" or "Estelle" meaning "Star".
  SunSymbol (â˜‰) // For names like "Sol" or "Cyrus" meaning "Sun".
  MoonSymbol (â˜¾) // For names like "Luna" or "Selene" meaning "Moon".
  
// Define how to handle initials or significant letters.
DEFINE InitialSymbols:
  Symbol for Initial Letters: Point (â€¢) for beginnings, or assign custom symbols for key letters.

// Step 3: Construct the Character Profile Using UWS
// Combine the mapped symbols into a coherent structure using UWS grammar rules.

// a. Define Core Symbol Structure
// Select a primary symbol to represent the character's fundamental essence or identity.
DEFINE CoreSymbol:
  SELECT Primary BaseSymbol for character's core identity or essence:
    // Example logic for selecting the core symbol.
    IF Origin = "Celestial" THEN CoreSymbol = Circle (â—¯) // Wholeness, cosmic origin.
    IF Trait = "Brave" THEN CoreSymbol = Triangle (â–³) // Strength, stability.

// b. Add Personality and Role Symbols
// Layer additional symbols on top of or adjacent to the core symbol.
DEFINE PersonalitySymbols:
  // Add a collection of symbols that represent the character's main personality traits.
  ADD symbols that represent personality traits:
    IF Trait = Brave THEN ADD Triangle (â–³)
    IF Trait = Wise THEN ADD Spiral (ðŸŒ€)
    IF Trait = Mysterious THEN ADD Wave (â‰ˆ)

// Select a symbol that represents the character's role or class.
DEFINE RoleSymbol:
  SELECT Role:
    IF Role = "Warrior" THEN RoleSymbol = SwordSymbol (âš”)
    IF Role = "Mage" THEN RoleSymbol = StarSymbol (âœ¶)

// c. Incorporate Astrological Symbols
// Combine the element and modality symbols to create an astrological signature.
DEFINE AstrologicalProfile:
  ElementSymbol = Elements from AstrologicalData (e.g., Fire, Water)
  ModalitySymbol = Modalities (e.g., Cardinal, Fixed)
  
// This combination creates a more nuanced astrological symbol.
COMBINE:
  ElementSymbol + ModalitySymbol:
    // Example: A Cardinal Fire sign (Aries) would combine the symbols for Angle and Fire.
    Example: Cardinal Fire (Angle + FireSymbol â†‘)

// d. Apply Grammar and Syntax Rules
// Reference the grammatical rules for arranging the final symbols.
DEFINE SymbolCombination:
  Adjacency: Place symbols side by side to combine meanings.
  Superimposition: Overlay symbols to merge meanings.
  Encapsulation: Enclose one symbol within another to indicate containment.

// Example of a final character symbol structure using these rules.
CharacterSymbol:
  Encapsulate(
    Superimpose(
      CoreSymbol,
      PersonalitySymbols
    ),
    RoleSymbol
  )
  AdjacentTo(
    ElementSymbol,
    ModalitySymbol
  )
  Enclose(
    NameSymbol
  )

// Step 4: Create the Symbolic Representation
// This step involves drafting the final visual layout of the character's symbol.

// a. Draft the Symbol Sequence
// Define the final combined symbol using the grammar rules.
DEFINE CharacterSymbol:
  // Example construction:
  Encapsulate(
    Superimpose(
      CoreSymbol, 
      PersonalitySymbols // Combine core identity with personality traits.
    ),
    RoleSymbol // Overlay the result with the character's role symbol.
  )
  AdjacentTo(
    ElementSymbol, // Place the astrological element symbol nearby.
    ModalitySymbol // Place the astrological modality symbol nearby.
  )
  Enclose(
    NameSymbol // Encapsulate the entire structure with the characterâ€™s name symbol.
  )

// b. Visual Arrangement
// This is a conceptual step describing the final artistic layout.
// The arrangement should be aesthetically pleasing and semantically meaningful.
// For example: Core and Personality symbols at the center, surrounded by astrological and name symbols.

// Output the final symbolic structure (conceptually).
PRINT CharacterSymbol

// Step 5: Interpret the Combined Symbols
// The final step is to provide a textual interpretation of the complete symbolic profile.
// This explains what each symbol and its placement means for the character.
DEFINE Interpretation:
  CoreSymbol: Represents the character's core essence (e.g., "Circle for celestial origin").
  PersonalitySymbols: Each symbol represents a specific trait (e.g., "Triangle for bravery").
  RoleSymbol: The character's profession or archetype (e.g., "Sword for Warrior").
  AstrologicalProfile: Represents their elemental and modal alignment (e.g., "Cardinal Fire for initiative and passion").
  NameSymbol: Encapsulates the character's identity via their name's meaning.

// Output the final interpretation as a text description.
PRINT Interpretation

// End of Pseudocode
